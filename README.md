# STEPS BY STEPS PROCESS 

## `Step 1:` Storing Your Website’s HTML Files with S3

To begin, we utilize `Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)` as a storage solution for our website’s `HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files`. S3 offers highly durable and scalable object storage, making it an ideal choice for hosting static content. By creating an S3 bucket, you can securely store and manage your website’s files. 

* Start by creating a new bucket, and picking a unique Name and Region that suits you.
* Ensure that ACLs remain disabled, and be certain to enable the “Block all public access” setting to prevent any unauthorized public access to the contents stored in the bucket.
